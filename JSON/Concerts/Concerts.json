In 2002, with Sam Fogarino on drums, the band signed to Matador records and released <a href=\"spotify:album:4sW8Eql2e2kdRP1A1R1clG\" data-name=\"Turn On The Bright Lights\">Turn On The Bright Lights</a> which made it to 10th position on NME’s list of 2002’s top releases and Pitchfork named it the year’s #1 album.\n \nOver the next decade and a half Interpol would go on to wide critical and commercial acclaim, with five subsequent high charting records on the Billboard 200; earning rave reviews across the map from Rolling Stone to TIME; performing on late night television shows including The Late Show with David Letterman and Conan and playing major festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury and headlining Mexico’s Corona Capital.\n \nThe band (Banks, Kessler and Fogarino) have just finished recording &#39;The Other Side of Make-Believe,&#39; their latest studio album with legendary production duo Flood &amp; Moulder, out on Matador Records, worldwide, July 15th.

He has been compared to some of the top songwriters of our time, including John Lennon, Paul Simon, John Prine and Bob Dylan. Known for his engaging, thought-provoking, witty, word labyrinths, his music spans topics from love and loss to social commentary, to ethereal train of thought abstractions and everything in between.\n​\nMatt’s DIY work ethic has seen him tour the US many times playing coffee shops, clubs, basements, living rooms, sidewalks…wherever there are people who want to hear his music. Along the way he has managed to share the stage with Maroon 5, Fallout Boy, Ani DiFranco, Rilo Kiley, Alkaline Trio, NOFX, Arlo Guthrie, Bad Brains, the late Pete Seeger and many others.\nMatt was the inspiration for Occupy This Album which grew out of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and both wrote and performed the opening song for the compilation. This disc combined both well-known and unknown artists and featured Jackson Browne, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Yoko Ono, Willie Nelson, Deborah Harry, Loudon Wainwright III, Arlo Guthrie, and many others.  \n\nA consummate performer with a high-energy stage presence, Matt’s universally relate-able songs will make you tap your foot, and ultimately tap your mind.

Songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist Sonia Sturino is supported by Annie Hoffman (bass/vocals) and Adam Hand (drums), filling out a mature and emotive sound. \n \nCentral to the record thematically is the empty threat of quitting music and “getting a real job.” Sturino wrestles with her relationship with music on the title track, shouting “I love it, but it never really feels okay” over scorching guitars. Despite the implications of the title, quitting is not an option for the band.  Even as friends settle into adulthood, Weakened Friends find themselves trapped in a fortress of their own creation, inseparably attached to the eternal youthfulness of life in music. In this liminal zone, life passes by and friendships are weakened, and Quitter takes plenty of time to mourn these losses.\n\nQuitter will be released on November 19, 2021.\n",

This indie/pop darling mixes the sonic and anthemic elements of monumental artists like The Killers, Beck and Amy  Winehouse as well as the sophistication of songwriting greats like Paul Simon and Joni  Mitchell.  \n\nA Virginia native, Freddy set up camp in Brooklyn in the fall 2008 after graduating with  esteem from Berklee College of Music, in Boston MA. He quickly made a name for  himself touring with Duncan Sheik’s Tony award winning musical Spring Awakening. \n\nFreddy has worked with songwriting giants like Carole King, Green Day’s Billie Joe  Armstrong, and Vanessa Carlton. His musicianship has been featured on Disney&#43;, This  American Life, Billboard, and as a staff favorite of Performer Magazine. \n\nFreddy comes alive when he steps on stage. His ability to connect with his audience has launched him into venues of all shapes and sizes. From Lincoln Center, to makeshift  stages in living rooms, his engaging and energetic performances have earned him a  diverse and dedicated fan base. \n\nEarlier this year Freddy teamed up with producer Anthony “Rocky” Gallo (John Legend,  Cigarettes After Sex) to record his third studio album Dazy. Dazy, due out this Fall, is a journey of self-discovery through loss, and is offered as a  beacon of hope, especially to the most fragile among us.\n",

Originally composed of five music majors from Howard University trying to raise money for tuition during the Christmas season, they have now grown to an 9-piece ensemble consisting of brass, a rhythm section, and vocalists. Gaining popularity from playing at local Metro stations, DuPont Brass started out professionally playing for weddings, banquets, and other private events in the surrounding area. Thanks to the foundation laid in their earlier years, DuPont Brass has had the opportunity to perform in conjunction with the D.C. Jazz Festival, The Washington Performing Arts Society, and on the prestigious Kennedy Center Millennium Stage. Consistently touching the hearts of the community with their heartwarming testimony, DuPont Brass has been featured on WPFW&#39;s “Live at Five” three times and featured in the Washington Post Newspaper five times. Through their training in both classical and contemporary styles, the rising supergroup has developed a sound that mixes varied genres of music, including jazz, hip-hop, and R&amp;B. In their latest effort, Music Education, DuPont Brass shows us why they are qualified to excel in both the education and performance arenas of the music industry. Filled with a diverse arsenal of musical styles, they present a body of work made with every kind of listener in mind. \n ",

The band originally formed at Indiana’s Anderson University, and since signing with Fervent Records/Word Entertainment, they’ve been nominated for a BillboardMusic Award, multiple K-LOVE Fan Awards and four Dove Awards, taking home the New Artist of the Year Dove in 2010. Over the course of their career, they’ve played for more than 2.5 million fans, and counting. Known for spending more days on the road than anywhere else, Sidewalk Prophets’ most recent tours (The Great Big Family Room Tour, The Prodigal Tour) have morphed into interactive experiences for the band and fans alike. Sidewalk Prophets will continue to set precedence with their creative live shows as a part of this fall’s Big Church Night Out Tour, alongside Newsboys, Blanca, 7eventh Time Down, and others.",

After censorship and restriction by Iranian authorities, its musicians immigrated to the U.S. and Canada. The band has since toured throughout the world and released 10 albums. Kiosk is known for its satirical lyrics, which provide a socio-political commentary of life in Iran, as well as its blend of several music styles, from Iranian folk to gypsy jazz to rock. Kiosk&#39;s music has been described by BBC World as &quot;songs that speak to a generation...Kiosk&#39;s stinging political satire is hidden within its blues and folksy sound.&quot; Haaretz has referred to Kiosk as the most popular Iranian rock band in the Iranian diaspora, while Ahram Online describes how the band gives a voice to their generation. Kiosk&#39;s live album &quot;Triple Distilled,&quot; recorded at Yoshi&#39;s Jazz Club, was chosen by presenter Mark Coles from BBC World&#39;s &quot;World of Music&quot; as one of the ten best world music albums of the year, alongside such artists as Paolo Conte and Ali Farka Touré. TIME Magazine has called Kiosk &quot;a band that can criticize the Iranian government without retribution,&quot; while Frontline PBS has praised their &quot;eclectic sound that incorporates a multitude of instruments and styles.&quot;\nCurrent Kiosk members include Ali Kamali (bass, recording engineer), Arash Sobhani (lyricist and songwriter, guitar, vocals) and Shahrouz Molaei (drum).\n",

Just remember to stay hydrated.\n\nIn addition to their reputation as must-see live performers, the Company&#39;s prolific immunity to writer&#39;s block has led them to release over 100 original songs between 14 releases over a period of just 7 years, with much more to come in 2023.

As they sharpened their showmanship and songcraft in the Maryland jam scene, LITZ ventured forth, opening for names like Papadosio and Lotus while adding Electric Forest, Resonance, and Peach to their festival accolades. \n\nThe foursome–Austin Litz (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), Logan Litz (bass), Dan Gallerman (guitar), and Nick Thrasher (Drums)--are constantly producing new tracks that defy categorization musically and metaphysically. Combining funky horn riffs, wah-wah keys, pounding bass, flute, and sensational guitar, they curate a sound that isn’t decisively funk, jam, go-go, or soul but irrefutably and exquisitely LITZ.\n\nOn stage, LITZ are custodians of the audience’s dreams, fears, and hopes. Their mesmerizing synergy and improvisation inspire authentic connection, reminding us that music, more than a sound, is a feeling. No two LITZ experiences are identical. As they riff and take risks, LITZ rocks their audiences’ senses and souls, pulling listeners into new realms of emotion. Ecstatic introspection, laughs with friends, and dances shared with strangers are equally part of the LITZ odyssey.\n\nWebsite: www.LITZmusic.com\nYouTube: www.YouTube.com/LITZjams",

                  "bio": "For over a century, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO) has been recognized as one of America’s leading orchestras and one of Maryland’s most significant cultural institutions. Under the direction of music director Marin Alsop, the orchestra is internationally renowned and locally admired for its innovation, performances, recordings and educational outreach initiatives including OrchKids. Launched by Marin Alsop and the BSO in 2008, OrchKids provides children with educational resources and fosters social change.\n\nThe BSO is widely recognized for its highly acclaimed recordings, including a 2010 disc on the Decca label featuring Gershwin’s Piano Concerto in F and Rhapsody in Blue, as well as the 2017 Naxos release of Bernstein’s Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2. Both recordings were led by Alsop and feature pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet. Alsop also led the BSO in its 2009 Naxos recording of Leonard Bernstein’s MASS. Recent releases include Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet with Alsop and Handel’s Messiah with conductor Edward Polochick and the Concert Artists of Baltimore Symphonic Chorale.\n\nThe Baltimore Symphony Orchestra performs annually for more than 350,000 people throughout the State of Maryland. Since 1982, the BSO has performed at the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall in Baltimore. In 2005, with the opening of The Music Center at Strathmore in North Bethesda, MD, the BSO became the nation’s first orchestra with year-round venues in two metropolitan areas.\n",
